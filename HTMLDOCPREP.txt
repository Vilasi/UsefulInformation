<!DOCTYPE html> 
<html>
MUST BE THE FIRST LINE OF CODE IN AN HTML DOCUMENT

Always save HTML files with a .html extension

<head>   : Comes before the <body> and contains metadata about the page.
	
<head> 
  <title>codeacadamy</title>    :The title of the web page is contained within the <head>. This is the title that will be given when indexing the page.
</head>

</html>


ADDING LINKS TO OTHER WEB PAGES (requires the href attribute):
([href = hyperlink reference])

<a href="link.com">This is my link text</a>

target : atribute that determines how a link will open.
   target="_blank" wil cause it to open in a new window.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_bear" target="_blank">The Brown Bear</a>

RELATIVE PATH: This can be used to link to other html files that are contained within the same folder (which contains the full html project). This may appear as:

	<a href="./contact.html">Contact</a>

Images can be used as links by wrapping the <img> element with a link element <a>

		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opuntia" target="_blank"><img src="#" 			alt="A red prickly pear fruit"/></a>

LINKING TO A TARGET WITHIN THE PAGE

an "id" can be added within an opening tag.
e.g. <p id="top">This is the Top Paragraph</p>

it can then be linked to later in the page

(e.g. ordered list of links) <ol>
			        <li><a href="#top">Top</a></li>
				</ol>


Two spaces of indentation (for nested objects) are starndard for readable HTML code.

Comments may be added by <!-- Comment/Test Code -->
	This is useful not only for adding comments, but for keeping code that you may want to 	
	implement later.


TABLES AND TABLE HEADINGS:

<table> : For creating a table of data
<tr> :To create a row element
<td> :Table Data Element, for creating a column
<th> for creating a table heading
    Attributes: <th scope="col"> or scope="row", to make it clear what the heading is for, a       	column or a row

eg <table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th scope="col">Saturday</th>
    <th scope="col">Sunday</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th scope="row">Temperature</th>
    <td>73</td>
    <td>81</td>
  </tr>
</table>

SPANNING COLUMNS & ROWS: 
For tables with data that spans multiple columns
Attribut: colspan= >=1

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Monday</th>
    <th>Tuesday</th>
    <th>Wednesday</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2">Out of Town</td>
    <td>Back in Town</td>
  </tr>
</table>

In the example above, the data Out of Town spans the Monday and Tuesday table headings using the value 2 (two columns). The data Back in Town appear only under the Wednesday heading.

For tables with data that spans multiple rows:
Attribute: rowspan=">=1" 
(e.g.) Spanning a <td> across 2 rows : <td rowspan="2"></td>


TABLE BODY: <tbody></tbody> : This should contain all of the table's data except for the headings.

TABLE HEAD: <thead></thead> : This should contain all of the table's headings

TABLE FOOT: <tfoot></tfoot> : This contains all of the footing of the table.
