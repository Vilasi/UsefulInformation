INLINE STYLES: For writing CSS code directly in an HTML document
The "style" attribute can be added directly to the opening tag.
	After the attribute is added, it can be set equal to the CSS style you want to apply.

	<p style="color: red;">I'm learning to code!</p>

	The style attribute is set equal to color: red;

	These can be added indefinitely, seperated by a semi colon ; 
	
	<p style="color: red; font-size: 20px;">I'm learning to code!</p>



THE <style> TAG: A dedicated section for CSS code.

	This must be placed within the <head>  
					<style>
					</style>
				       </head>

	An example of changing the font of paragraphs in the HTML file:
					<style>
   					 p{
     				            font-family: Arial;
  					  }
    
 					 </style>


THE STYLE.CSS FILE:

To keep code types separated, a .css file can be linked to from within the HTML file.

<link> : Used to link to the .css

You can use the <link> element to link HTML and CSS files together. The <link> element must be placed within the head of the HTML file. It is a self-closing tag and requires the following three attributes:

    href — like the anchor element, the value of this attribute must be the address, or path, to the CSS file.

    type — this attribute describes the type of document that you are linking to (in this case, a CSS file). The value of this attribute should be set to text/css.

    rel — this attribute describes the relationship between the HTML file and the CSS file. Because you are linking to a stylesheet, the value should be set to stylesheet.

	For Example: <link href="https://www.codecademy.com/stylesheets/style.css" type="text/css" 				rel="stylesheet">

	If stored in the same folder, the href can link to a relative path
	IE href="./style.css"


CSS SELECTORS: For selecting HTML elements to be affected.
	The css selector will match the HTML tag.

<p> : Paragraphs 
	p {
	}

HTML tags can have have attributes. For example class
	<p class="brand">Sole Shoe Company</p>

	CSS can select these attributes

	To select "brand" we can write, in CSS

	.brand {
	}
