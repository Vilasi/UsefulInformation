															DATA TYPES:

Numbers:

0-9

Infinity, -Infinity

NaN

	NaN will propagate through an expression, and will return itself 
		as opposed to an error.










															STRINGS:

Must be inside of quotes.

""  &  ''   both serve identically.

``          (backticks) can be used to embed something else, such that
		`Two plus two equals ${2 + 2}`;

A string may be a single character eg. (c)


If an error such as 

	unterminated string literal

Go back through and make sure all strings are contained within quotation marks.









															BOOLEAN:

True or False

	let nameFieldChecked = true; // yes, name field is checked
	let ageFieldChecked = false; // no, age field is not checked


Booleans also come as the result of comparisons, eg:
	
	let isGreater = 4 > 1;

	alert( isGreater ); // true (the comparison result is "yes")









															NULL:

Empty. Nothing. Refers to Nothing Else. It's just an empty nothing.

	let age = null;

		The value of age is unknown











															UNDEFINED:

A value is not assigned

If a variable is declared but not assigned a value,
	the value is undefined

	let x;

	alert(x); // shows "undefined"

Technically, you can do

	let x = 123;

	x = undefined;

	alert(x); // "undefined"

It is advisable to not do this, and to instead assign a value of "null"
to variables that don't have a value.

Undefined can be used as a check to see if a variable has a value.









															OBJECTS & SYMBOLS

object is a non-primitave data type used to store lareger collections of data.

The symbol type is used to create unique lables for objects.














															TYPEOF

The typeof operator returns the type of the argument.

It's useful for processing values of different types differently,
	or for a quick check of what datatype a variable is.

Two forms of Syntax:
	
    As an operator: typeof x

    Function style: typeof(x)

	These both work exactly the same


Examples:

	typeof undefined // "undefined"

	typeof 0 // "number"

	typeof true // "boolean"

	typeof "foo" // "string"

	typeof Symbol("id") // "symbol"

	typeof Math // "object"  (1)

	typeof null // "object"  (2)

	typeof alert // "function"  (3)
